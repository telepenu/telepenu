# ENGRAVED

>hi. i am enes,an electronicengineer who broke away from the heart of anatolian steppes where king telepinu lives.
I always wanted to be a developer but procrastination got in the way.
i think there is strong connection between dopamine and addiction.
At the end of the day, I'm going to get rid of all my addiction that cause procrastination and direct them to be a developer.

my main objective is to make the world a better place and carve my name into a eternal(till the collision between our Milky Way galaxy and the Andromeda) stone.

Programming languages I will learn(that will be ticked after i learn most of grammatic syntaxes):

1. [_] java and kotlin for android development
2. [_] a database lang
3. [_] python
4. [_] js for api development
